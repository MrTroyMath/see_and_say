# Dog goes "woof"
# Cat goes "meow"
# Bird goes "tweet"
# And mouse goes "squeek"
# Cow goes "moo"
# Frog goes "croak"
# And the elephant goes "toot"
# Ducks say "quack"
# And fish go "blub"
# And the seal goes "ow ow ow"
# But there's one sound
# That no one knows
# What does the fox say?
# "Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
# Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!
# Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding!"
